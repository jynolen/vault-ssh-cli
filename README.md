Automate signing SSH host- and client certificates for a more secure and scalable infrastructure. 

## Features

üè≠ Sign SSH host public keys to verify that a client securely connects to an (previously unknown) box

üë®‚Äçüíª Sign SSH user public keys to allow a client connecting via certificate without the need to synchronize `authorized_keys` on all boxes

üîó Read a CA from a given path from Vault

üõÇ Authenticate against Vault using AppRole, (explicit) token or implicit__ auth

üíª Runs effortlessly both on your workstation's CLI via command line flags or automated via systemd and config files on your server

‚è∞ Automatically renews certificates based on its lifetime

üî≠ Provides metrics to increase observability for robust automation

## Installation

### Pre-compiled Binaries

Pre-compiled binaries can be found at the releases section. They are signed using a cryptographic signature made by [signify](https://man.openbsd.org/signify.1) using the following public key: 
```
untrusted comment: signify public key
RWSFxNuvQMx07H1IC6sUxJvlsdtfDlY39EdoHMG/ZpivtOmp8sJ3DMEg
```

To verify the cryptographic signature, run
```bash
$ signify -V -p /path/to/downloaded/pubkey -m checksum.sha256
$ sha256sum -c checksum.sha256
```

### Building it from source

```sh
$ go install github.com/soerenschneider/vault-ssh-cli@latest
```

## Configuration
Configuration is supported via CLI arguments, ENV variables and through yaml-encoded config files.

## Example

### Sign a user key
```bash
vault-ssh-cli sign-user-key \
     -a https://my-vault:8200 \
     --vault-ssh-role=user \
     --vault-auth-implicit=true \
     --pub-key-file=/etc/ssh/ssh_host_ed25519_key.pub
```

### Configuration via ENV variables
All configuration variables must be prefixed with `SSH_KEY_SIGNER`.

### Configuration Files
By default, config files named `config.yaml` are sought for at locations `$HOME/.config/vault-ssh-cli` and `/etc/vault-ssh-cli`.

## Automating Key Signatures
`vault-ssh-cli` is suited to be scheduled continuously by an external actor such as systemd or (Kubernetes) cron jobs and only renew a certificate after its expiration period has passed a certain threshold.

## Metrics

### Collecting the metrics

‚úÖ Dumping metrics to disk to be picked up by Prometheus node_exporter

‚ùå Pushing metrics to Prometheus Pushgateway

### Available metrics

All metrics are exposed using the prefix `ssh_key_signer`

| Name                        | Type    | Description                                            |

| cert_expiry_seconds         | Gauge   | The date after the cert is not valid anymore           |
| cert_lifetime_seconds_total | Gauge   | The total number of seconds this certificate is valid  |
| cert_lifetime_percent       | Gauge   | The passed lifetime of the certificate in percent      | 
| run_timestamp_seconds       | Gauge   | The date after the cert is not valid anymore           |


## Configuring 3rd party Systems

### Vault Configuration
Vault needs to be configured with a SSH secret engine, see [this TF module](https://github.com/soerenschneider/tf-vault/tree/main/secret_ssh).
